    <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <p>If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
            · Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
            · Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
            · Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
            · Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
            · Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
            · Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
            · Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
            · Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</p>
